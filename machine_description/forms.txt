ALFE in-memory form:
  Sequence of statements
  Operators replaced with function calls (apart from && and ||)
  Want to be able to have chunks of ALFE with "holes" to be replaced? Or are these holes just function/template arguments?

ALFE text form:
  Equivalent to source code
  What about annotations?

ALFE binary form:
  Persisted intermediate format?
